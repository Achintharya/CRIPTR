CRIPTR is a text encryption and decryption tool with a simple and user-friendly GUI built using python and tkinter that allows users to encrypt data using a custom algorithm. It employs a username-password authentication to access decryption, and also saves the encrypted data temporarily in a file until new data is encrypted.
