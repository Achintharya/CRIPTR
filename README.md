CRIPTR is a text encoding and decoding tool with a simple and user-friendly GUI built using python and customtkinter that allows users to encode data using a custom algorithm that uses translation and hash values. It employs a username-password authentication to access decryption, and also saves the encoded data temporarily in a file until new data is encrypted.
